# 2023 React App:
2023 react app it's just a generic name to show essentially my understanding of 3 react fundamental toppics:

1. React router v6
2. React query 
3. unit testing with vitest and react testing library
4. redux

## React router v6 basics are already covered in this project

## React query:

```bash
$ npm i @tanstack/react-query
# or
$ pnpm add @tanstack/react-query
# or
$ yarn add @tanstack/react-query 
```

React query usage, at least setup is similar to React Router, basically you create a client, and envolve the whole app, *or the screens/components which you wish to allow access to the client* in something called provider/consumer
 **it's good to understand this basic common patterns**, because they are somehow the foundation of React procedures, **client and context of usage** is a good short definition for it.
